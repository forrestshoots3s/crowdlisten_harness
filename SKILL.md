## Quick Start

```bash
# Install and auto-configure
npx @crowdlisten/harness login

# Or connect via HTTP
{ "url": "https://mcp.crowdlisten.com/mcp" }
```

## Transports

| Transport | URL | Auth |
|-----------|-----|------|
| stdio | `npx @crowdlisten/harness` | Browser login (stored in ~/.crowdlisten/) |
| HTTP | `https://mcp.crowdlisten.com/mcp` | Bearer token (JWT or API key) |
| REST | `https://mcp.crowdlisten.com/tools/{name}` | Bearer token |

## Core Workflow

```
list_tasks → claim_task → recall → create_plan → execute_task → get_execution_status (poll) → save → complete_task
```

Every task captures decisions, patterns, and learnings via `save`. Run `sync_context({ organize: true })` to organize. Browse `~/.crowdlisten/context/INDEX.md` to navigate.
